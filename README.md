## Info 🔵
This uses the [Away3D](https://github.com/openfl/away3d) frame work from OpenFL and makes it renderable in [HaxeFlixel](https://github.com/HaxeFlixel/flixel) as a FlxSprite. With some rendering workarounds in the FlxView3D and Main File, this is possible.

[Away3D](https://github.com/openfl/away3d) uses View3D as its primary container so that is what the FlxView3D works with. 

### Limitations 🔴
- Can not render a model with more then **ONE** texture (can have specular and normal maps).
- Only supports the follow file formats; `.obj, .awd, .3ds, .ac3d, .md2, .md5, .dae, .dfx`.
- Amount of View3Ds allowed limited to `FlxG.stage.stage3Ds.length` (preformance dependent in some cases).

## Requirements 🟡

- The Away3D OpenFL Library; ` openfl install away3d`
- Adding the Library to your Project.xml; `<haxelib name="away3d"/>`
